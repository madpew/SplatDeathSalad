SplatDeathSalad PEW
===================
This is a modified version of SplatDeathSalad, a game by Sophie Houlden for the 7dfps-competition.

Play it here: http://pixelsiege.net/sdspew/

Since this repository never got updated to the last version and the sources have long been lost I decided to upload the last version I could recover from a broken harddrive.
Good luck: http://pixelsiege.net/ref/2014/SDSPEW_recovered.zip
